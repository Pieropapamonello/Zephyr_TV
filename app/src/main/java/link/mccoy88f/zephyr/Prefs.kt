/**
 * Every key Zephyr TV keeps settings and state under, in one place: a mistyped key is a setting that silently never
 * saves. They live in the "home" preferences file (Plume's name, kept so the code stays a clean fork of it).
 * Per-app entries add the package to a prefix: "t_<package>" (when an app was last opened from a card),
 * "n_<package>" (how often it was opened from the row).
