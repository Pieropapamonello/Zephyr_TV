# Changelog

Piume shows the section for its own version in **Piume settings → Updates** after an update.
The build stops if `versionName` has no section here.

Write every entry in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English:

- Write one idea in each sentence. Use 20 words or fewer in each sentence.
- Use the active voice and the present tense.
- Write instructions as commands: "Select **Updates**", not "**Updates** can be selected".
- Use one word for one thing. Use the names that Piume shows on the screen.
- Start each entry with "- ". Piume shows each entry as one item. It removes `**` marks.

Put changes that are not released under `## Unreleased`. Rename that heading to the version number when you release.

## Unreleased

## 4.0.0-beta.1

- This version is a beta. Piume does not offer it as an update. To try it, install Piume.apk by hand.
- Piume settings have a new section, **Stremio add-ons**. Select **Add an add-on** and type the address of the add-on's manifest. You can also paste it on your phone.
- The TV channels of an add-on show as rows. The first row has all the channels. Then each category has a row of its own.
- Select **TV channels** to choose where the rows show: **In the TV app**, **In an IPTV app** or **An app per add-on**. Without a TV app, they show in the IPTV app.
- An app per add-on has the add-on's name and logo, from its manifest.
- Select a channel to play it in the Piume player. If a stream does not play, the player tries the next stream.
- The cards show the program on now, if the add-on gives it.
- Piume reads the channels of each add-on again every 15 minutes.
- The backup includes the add-ons.
- Piume is larger: about 1.2 MB. The player needs the extra space.

## 3.1

- The settings section **Continue Watching** is now called **Content**.
