# Changelog

Piume shows the section for its own version in **Piume settings → Updates** after an update.
The build stops if `versionName` has no section here.

Write every entry in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English:

- Write one idea in each sentence. Use 20 words or fewer in each sentence.
- Use the active voice and the present tense.
- Write instructions as commands: "Select **Updates**", not "**Updates** can be selected".
- Use one word for one thing. Use the names that Piume shows on the screen.
- Start each entry with "- ". Piume shows each entry as one item. It removes `**` marks.

Put changes that are not released under `## Unreleased`. Rename that heading to the version number when you release.
