  <em>Light as feathers.</em> A minimal, ad-free home screen for Android TV and Google TV.

> [!NOTE]
> **Piume** (Italian for *feathers*) is a fork of [**Plume Launcher**](https://github.com/aradhyas8/Plume_Launcher) by [aradhyas8](https://github.com/aradhyas8). It keeps Plume's small, fast design and adds Italian, Spanish and French translations, a TMDB Spotlight of trending films and series (or other TMDB lists, or your own), recommendations per app, TV channels with logos and what's on, search across TMDB and the TV's channels, grouped settings, a TV inputs menu, night mode, settings backup and readability changes. Piume installs next to Plume: it has its own package name (`dev.piume`) and its own updates. See [Credits](#credits) for everyone whose work it builds on.

Piume replaces the cluttered stock home screen with the two things you actually use: your apps and what you were watching. There are no ads, no sponsored rows, no account and no tracking, and it stays out of the way of the apps it launches.

## Highlights

- **Tiny and fast.** A 0.5 MB APK with no third-party libraries. It uses about 50–70 MB of RAM and has no extra background services.
- **Home button support on Google TV.** The Home button opens Piume directly, even on devices where the system launcher can't be replaced. Holding Home still opens the Google TV dashboard.
- **Play queue.** The first tile shows what's playing now in any app (Spotify, YouTube…) with its art and progress, then **Continue Playing**: resume shows and films from Android TV's Watch Next list and from apps that publish their own "Continue Watching" channel, such as Stremio.
- **App sections.** Each row an app puts on the home screen (for example YouTube's Recommended and Trending) is its own section under your Favourites. Hold OK on the app and select **Visible sections** to choose them. The TV app shows all the TV's channels from channel 1, one section per tuner, 10 at a time as you move along.
- **Favourites.** Your apps as monochrome logos (or the same logos in brand colour) in a single row, with names on focus, always or never. Rearrange it by holding OK, sort by most used, or hide apps you don't use (they stay in All apps). An optional PIN locks the layout so small hands can't rearrange it.
- **HDMI inputs as apps.** A console or set-top box that names itself over HDMI-CEC (for example "PlayStation 5") gets its own tile, which switches the TV to that input.
- **Light, dark, Glass or automatic theme**, each with its own wallpaper. Glass shows the wallpaper through glossy see-through cards, with white text. Add your own photos from your phone by scanning a QR code, or show a folder of photos from the TV or a USB drive that changes on a timer.
- **Optional TMDB Spotlight.** Trending films and series, another TMDB list (popular, top rated, in cinemas, coming soon, on the air), or your own public TMDB list, above your Favourites, with their backdrop as the wallpaper. It changes title every few seconds, in a random order. Buttons open the title in Nuvio (by TMDB id) or Stremio (by IMDb id), play its YouTube trailer, or open a streaming app that has it in your country.
- **Optional Gallery screensaver.** Public-domain landscape paintings in 16:9, downloaded only if you choose it, a folder of your own photos, or the Spotlight backdrops with their titles.
- **Optional weather** under the clock, and a 12- or 24-hour clock.
- **Night mode.** Between the hours you choose, the home screen goes darker and Spotlight stops.
- **TV channels with logos and what's on.** Each channel card shows the channel's logo, from the TV or else from [iptv-org](https://github.com/iptv-org/database), and the program on now with a progress bar, from a TV guide in XMLTV format that you choose.
- **Search** from the top bar: type with the remote, say it, or type on your phone. Films, series and TV channels show in their own rows under a **Results** tile in your Favourites. OK on a film or series shows its description, the trailer and the apps that have it; OK on a channel shows what's on and **Watch on TV**.
- **Your phone as a keyboard.** Scan a QR code to send a wallpaper, type the TMDB key or list, a search or the TV guide's address, save a settings backup, or restore one.
- **Status at a glance.** A red dot on the network icon when there's no internet; a red dot on Piume settings when an update is ready, and on each item that leads to it.
- **Updates itself.** Piume checks its GitHub releases once a day and installs new versions from its settings. The first update asks you to allow installs from Piume.

## How it compares

Measured with Plume Launcher 1.3, the version Piume is based on, on a Hisense Google TV (Android 12, 1.8 GB RAM). Piume adds features, so its figures may be a little higher:

| | Plume 1.3 | Projectivy Launcher | Google TV launcher |
|---|---|---|---|
| APK size | **0.4 MB** | ~10–14 MB | ~25 MB |
| RAM while running | **~50–70 MB** | ~65–70 MB | ~93 MB, plus a ~22 MB helper process |
| Extra background services | **None** | 2 | 1 always-on helper |
| Return to home from an app | **~95 ms** | – | – |

## Requirements

- Android TV or Google TV running **Android 8.0 (Oreo) or newer**
- A way to sideload an APK: the *Downloader* app, a USB drive with a file manager, or `adb`

## Installation

1. Download the latest `Piume.apk` from the [Releases](https://github.com/mccoy88f/Piume_Launcher/releases/latest) page.
2. Install it on your TV, using any of these:
   - **Downloader app:** enter the release page address above.
   - **USB drive:** copy the APK over and open it with a file manager.
   - **adb:** `adb install Piume.apk`
3. Open **Piume** from your apps. A guided setup makes the Home button open it.

### First-run setup

On first launch Piume walks you through making Home open it. To run it again, open **Piume settings → System → Set up Home button**. The same section has the two rows it uses:

| Setting | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Home button** | Turn the switch on. In the Accessibility screen that opens, select **Piume: Home button** and turn it on. |
| **Default launcher** | Press OK and choose **Piume** in the dialog. |

Allow the **TV listings** permission when asked; Continue Playing needs it.

> [!NOTE]
> Android shows the same generic warning for every accessibility service. Piume's service only listens for the Home key and for the system launcher appearing. It cannot read screen content.

> [!TIP]
> **Android 13 and newer:** Android blocks sideloaded apps from Accessibility at first. Open **Settings → Apps → Piume**, choose **Allow restricted settings** from the menu, then turn the service on.

### Optional: grant one extra permission over adb

```sh
adb shell pm grant dev.piume android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
```

This lets Piume:
- set the Gallery screensaver from its own settings
- turn its Home button service back on automatically if the app is ever force-stopped

Everything else works without it.

### Home button on Android 13 and newer

Android 13 and newer grey out the Accessibility switch for apps installed outside the Play Store, and most Google TV builds hide the **Allow restricted settings** menu that would unlock it. If Piume's setup reaches the ADB step, unlock it once from a computer (or a phone ADB app) on the same network:

1. On the TV, open **Settings → System → About** and press **Android TV OS build** seven times to turn on Developer options.
2. In **Settings → System → Developer options**, turn on **Network debugging** (called **USB debugging** on some TVs).
3. Run these, using the address Piume shows:

   ```sh
   adb connect <tv-address>:5555
   adb shell pm grant dev.piume android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
   ```

4. Accept the debugging prompt on the TV, then choose **Try again** in Piume. Piume turns its Home button service on by itself.

## Using Piume

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Choose an app's sections on the home screen | Hold **OK** on the app, then **Visible sections** |
| Switch to the Glass theme | **Settings → Appearance & wallpapers → Theme → Glass** |
| Rearrange apps | Hold **OK** on an app, or use **Settings → Favourites → Edit Favourites** |
| Hide an item from Continue Playing or an app's section | Hold **OK** on its card, then **Remove from this section** |
| Remove an app from Favourites | Hold **OK** on it, then **Remove from Favourites** (it stays in *All apps*) |
| Choose which apps feed Continue Playing | **Settings → Content → Continue Playing apps** |
| Pin an app from *All apps* to the front | Open **All apps**, hold **OK** on the app (this also unhides it) |
| Hide apps from Favourites | **Settings → Favourites → Apps in Favourites** |
| Show app names always, on focus or never | **Settings → Favourites → App names** |
| Switch between monochrome and colour icons | **Settings → Favourites → Icon style** |
| Update Piume | **Settings → System → Updates** |
| Lock the layout with a PIN | **Settings → Favourites → Lock layout** |
| Show trending films and series on top (TMDB Spotlight) | **Settings → TMDB Spotlight → TMDB API Key** (type it on the TV or from your phone) |
| Choose what Spotlight shows (trending, popular, top rated, in cinemas…) | **Settings → TMDB Spotlight → Spotlight shows** |
| Show your own TMDB list in Spotlight | **Settings → TMDB Spotlight → Spotlight shows → My TMDB list** |
| Show what's on under the TV channels | **Settings → TV & IPTV → TV guide (XMLTV)** |
| Turn the channel logos from iptv-org on or off, or get the latest | **Settings → TV & IPTV → Channel logos (iptv-org)**, **Update the channel logos** |
| Clock in 12 or 24 hours | **Settings → Appearance & wallpapers → Clock** |
| Night mode | **Settings → Appearance & wallpapers → Night mode** |
| Back up or restore your settings | **Settings → System → Backup and restore** |
| See what did not work recently | **Settings → System → Recent problems** |
| Search for a film, a series or a TV channel | The **search** button in the top bar (hold OK on it for the TV's voice assistant) |
| Switch to an HDMI input | The **TV inputs** button in the top bar. A green dot shows the inputs with a device connected: Android's state, or on Sony TVs the TV's own (checked on Sony; on other brands it's as good as what the TV reports to Android) |
| Open the Google TV dashboard | Hold the **Home** button |

### Custom wallpapers

Open **Light mode wallpaper** or **Dark mode wallpaper** in Piume settings and choose **Add from phone…**. Scan the QR code with your phone (it must be on the same Wi-Fi as the TV), pick a photo and upload it. It becomes the wallpaper straight away. The TV turns it upright, crops it to the screen around its centre and saves a small copy. The upload page only works while that screen is open. **Remove a photo…** in the same list deletes one.

You can also copy `.jpg`, `.png` or `.webp` files to `Android/data/dev.piume/files/wallpapers/` yourself:

```sh
adb push my-wallpaper.jpg /sdcard/Android/data/dev.piume/files/wallpapers/
```

A gentle fade is added automatically so the rows stay readable (**Settings → Appearance & wallpapers → Photo fade** turns it off).

### Photo folders

Choose **Choose a folder on this TV…** in the wallpaper list to use a whole folder of photos, from the TV's storage or a USB drive. Piume asks for access to your photos the first time. The photos take turns in shuffled order; **Settings → Appearance & wallpapers → Folder photo changes** sets how often, from every minute to once a day. The screensaver can show a folder too: **Settings → Screensaver → Your photos**.

### Lock layout

**Settings → Favourites → Lock layout** sets a 4-digit PIN. While it's on, Piume settings and anything that changes the home screen (moving, removing or pinning apps, hiding shows) ask for the PIN first; opening apps works as usual. One PIN unlocks changes for five minutes, until you leave the home screen. Use the arrows or the remote's number keys to enter it.

The lock keeps the layout safe, it isn't parental control: apps can still be opened by voice search or from Android settings. Forgot the PIN? **Android Settings → Apps → Piume → Clear data** removes it, along with your layout and settings.

### TMDB Spotlight

Spotlight needs a free TMDB API key (v3 key or v4 read token) from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). Enter it in **Settings → TMDB Spotlight → TMDB API Key**, or choose **Enter from your phone** and scan the code; Piume checks the key with TMDB. Spotlight then shows the trending titles. **Spotlight shows** picks another of TMDB's lists instead: trending this week, popular, top rated, films now in cinemas or coming soon in your country, series on the air. **My TMDB list** shows a public list you made on themoviedb.org, in its own order: paste its link on your phone. It's selected only once a list is set.

Each title has buttons for Nuvio and Stremio (always shown, when installed), its YouTube trailer, and the streaming apps that have it in your country (**Only services that have the title** turns that filter off). Spotlight keeps its images on the TV, so each one downloads only once, and it stops after 15 minutes without a key press.

### TV channels and the TV guide

The TV app's section shows every channel the TV has tuned, in number order. Its logo comes from the TV, or, when the TV has none, from [iptv-org](https://github.com/iptv-org/database), a public-domain list of TV channels: Piume downloads the list for your country the first time and then once a month, matches the channels by name, and keeps the logos on the TV. **Update the channel logos** gets the latest now.

Android lets only system apps read the TV's own program guide, so for what's on Piume uses a TV guide from the internet, in XMLTV format (`.xml` or `.xml.gz`). Enter its address in **Settings → TV & IPTV → TV guide (XMLTV)**, or paste it on your phone. Piume downloads it twice a day and keeps the next day of it; each channel card then shows the program on now with a progress bar, and a channel's page in search shows its time, description and what's next. For Italy, `https://iptv-epg.org/files/epg-it.xml.gz` covers the national channels.

### Backup and restore

**Settings → System → Backup and restore** saves your settings to your phone as a small file, and sends one back to restore them. The backup has your layout, theme, Spotlight settings and TMDB key, but not your photos or the lock PIN. Keep it private: it has your TMDB key.

### Gallery screensaver

Select **Settings → Screensaver** to switch to Gallery. Piume downloads the paintings (4.7 MB) from Plume Launcher's releases and stores them privately. Switching back to another screensaver deletes them again, so they only take space while you use them. With a TMDB key you can choose **Spotlight trending (TMDB)** instead: it shows the backdrops Spotlight already keeps on the TV, with title, year and genre, and doesn't go online itself.

## Privacy

Piume has no analytics, no ads and no account. It only connects to the internet to:
- load poster images for your Continue Playing items
- check this repository's GitHub releases for a new version, once a day, and download it when you choose to update
- download the Gallery paintings from Plume Launcher's releases, **only if you choose that screensaver**
- fetch the weather, **only if you turn it on**. It looks up your approximate location from your IP address via [ipwho.is](https://ipwho.is), then gets the forecast from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com). A city you pick by hand is looked up with Open-Meteo's geocoding instead.
- show TMDB Spotlight and search, **only if you enter a TMDB API key**. It fetches the titles of the list you choose (or your own), search results, their genres, images, trailers, IMDb ids and streaming services from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org).
- download TV channel logos, **only for channels the TV has none for, and unless you turn it off**: the channel list from [iptv-org](https://iptv-org.github.io/api/) once a month, and each logo once from where iptv-org points (mostly Wikimedia and imgur).
- download a TV guide, **only if you enter its address**, twice a day.

The phone screens (**Add from phone…**, the TMDB key and list, search, the TV guide's address, backup and restore) run a small page on the TV itself, reachable only on your home network, only while that screen is open, and only at a long random address in its QR code. What you send goes straight between your phone and the TV and nowhere else. Android's own backup doesn't copy Piume's settings.

The Play queue shows what's playing from Android's media sessions, which Piume can see because it turns on a notification listener for itself (Android lets only the system allow it: run `adb shell cmd notification allow_listener dev.piume/dev.piume.PlayingListener` once; **Settings → Content → Show what's playing** shows whether it's on). It reads no notifications, and what's playing stays on the TV.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>The Home button still opens the old home screen</b></summary>

Check that **Settings → System → Home button** is on. If the app was force-stopped, Android turns its accessibility service off; open Piume once (or grant the optional adb permission above) to restore it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Continue Playing is empty</b></summary>

Make sure the TV listings permission is allowed (**Settings → Apps → Piume → Permissions**), and that the app you watch publishes to Android TV's Watch Next list. Check **Settings → Content → Continue Playing apps** in Piume too.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The screensaver option says it needs an adb permission</b></summary>

Google TV hides third-party screensavers from its own settings, so Piume needs the one-time `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` grant shown above to switch it for you.
</details>

## Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mccoy88f/Piume_Launcher.git
cd Piume_Launcher
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`. Without a `keystore.properties` file, release builds are signed with your local debug key, which is fine for installing your own build.

## Contributing

Bug reports, translations and pull requests are welcome. Piume stays small on purpose, so please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first: it lists what's in and out of scope and how to send a change. Open an issue before starting on a feature.
